## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
#### This project implements a smart thermostat system using a Raspberry Pi, designed to create an intuitive and multi-functional temperature control system with clear user feedback. The thermostat operates using three main states (Off, Heat, and Cool) managed through a state machine architecture, while continuously monitoring temperature data from an AHT20 sensor.

The system addresses several practical challenges:

• User interface clarity: Multiple output devices, including an LCD screen, seven-segment display, and LED indicators, provide redundant feedback so the user can easily understand the current system status at all times.

• International usability: Support for both Fahrenheit and Celsius allows temperature scale conversion without requiring different hardware setups for different regions.

• Remote monitoring: Serial communication enables temperature data logging and allows the system to be monitored remotely through a centralized server.

• Responsive operation: Threaded display management keeps the interface responsive while temperature readings and hardware control processes run continuously in the background.
